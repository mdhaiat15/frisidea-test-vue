## My process

### Built with

- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) - build tool
- [Vue3](https://vuejs.org/) - JS Framework
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) - Utility-first css framework
- [axios](https://axios-http.com/) - http client library
- [leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/) - JS map library
- [Netlify](https://app.netlify.com/) - deployment

### What I learned

I re-learn tailwind and leaflet js for vue. With tailwind, I explore style that can mock the design in real site. teh difficult thing is placing the form and result box in front of the map and header. very very tricky.     

### Continued development

next development is about maximize the information form geoipfy api. then, make the website more better ux. 

### Useful resources
